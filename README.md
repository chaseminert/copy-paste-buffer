# Copy Paste Buffer

## Project Overview
Copy Paste Buffer is a command-line interface (CLI) based utility that enhances productivity by allowing users to copy content to and paste content from multiple slots. This tool is especially useful for individuals in data transfer positions, enabling them to manage multiple pieces of information simultaneously without the constant need to switch between windows or documents.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Buffer Slots**: Users can copy content to up to 9 slots for easy retrieval.
- **Persistence**: Slot data is saved between sessions, allowing users to exit the program and return without losing their copied content.
- **CLI-Based Menu**: Navigate through options to copy, paste, view slot data, clear slots, or save and exit the program using simple command-line inputs.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the copy-paste process, saving time and enhancing efficiency for data management tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **PyAutoGUI**: Used for simulating key presses.
- **Pyperclip**: Manages clipboard operations.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaseminert/copy-paste-buffer.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd copy-paste-buffer

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Challenges Faced
Learning Python's dynamic typing was initially challenging, overcome by utilizing type annotations. The use of external libraries like PyAutoGUI and Pyperclip for clipboard management was mastered through thorough documentation review and code examples.
